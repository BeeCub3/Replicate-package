This is a replication package for a Systematic Literature review, currently under review.

In the file "Original search" you find the original papers identified from the database search. The rest of the proccess after automatic identification was performed in the tool Covidence. By using the tool browser client all annotating and management of data was performed via the tool, before the final export of the data extraction for further analysis. The Extraction can be summarized via the following PRISMA flow:
  
  
701 studies screened against title and abstract	

	382 studies excluded	 
319 studies assessed for full-text eligibility  

	170 studies excluded	
		101  Does not address early behaviour V&V  
		37  Does not propose concrete solutions/tools
		11  Full text not available
		9  Short papter, tutorial, etc
		6  Overlapping paper with a more complete paper
		6  Scope not in MBSE
149 studies included

In the file "Table for protocol" you can find the raw extraction of the papers identified in the study, seperated in colums per extracted item. These papers correspond to the papers that were included after applying the Inclusion and Exclusion criteria and was exported from the Covidence tool once all extraction was done. Additionally there are 2 seperate tabs for the exluded papers from the screening and full paper review respectivly.
